# Period-matrices
Magma code for Period matrices for Abelian varieties
* Grupo800-980.mgm. Contains the symplectic representation for G(800,980) on genus 101 with signature (0;8,8,2). Obtained with polyNoZ.m in https://github.com/rojas-ani/magma-routines. Outputs: 
  - a, b: Symplectic representation of the generators of G(800,980) of order 8 (corresponding to elements fixing points). The element of order 2 is ab.
  - G: The image of G(800,980) in Sp(202,Z)
  - H: The symplectic image of the unique abelian subgroup of G(800,980) of order 100.
